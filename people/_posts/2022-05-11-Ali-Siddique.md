Ali Siddique started his research in the RPG lab in August 2019. He was a Control System Engineer at CenterPoint Energy when he started the master's degree program. He mainly worked on risk-based microgrid energy management. He graduated in May 2022. 

He received the Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Houston in 2015. He has worked at National Instruments, CenterPoint Energy, and most recently ChargePoint. 

The title of his thesis is "*Microgrid Optimal Scheduling and Risk Analysis*".

<a class="off" href="/people/Ali-Siddique/">Ali Siddique</a> is the first (MS) student who graduated with a (MS) thesis in our group - the RPG Lab!

## Research Interests
His research focuses are renewable energy, microgrids, disaster preparedness, grid resiliency. His master's thesis is focused on Distributed Generation System Implementation in Disaster Scenarios by modeling conditional value-at-risk analysis on dynamic power flow optimization software for neighborhood microgrid with rooftop solar residential data for post-disaster scenarios. 

## Hobbies
He enjoys kayaking, hiking, reading, and climbing in his free time.

Jonathan Yang was a visiting K-12 (high school) student in the RPG lab at the University of Houston. During this visit, he conducted research under supervision of Dr. Xingpeng Li with help/support from two UH PhD students in the same team: Mingjian Tuo and Jin Lu. 

His research was mainly focused on learning-based load forecasting for the ERCOT region (majority of Texas power grid) for about one year. He was able to write and publish a conference paper for this work.

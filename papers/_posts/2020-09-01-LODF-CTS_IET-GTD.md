# Abstract

Transmission networks consist of thousands of branches for large-scale real power systems. They are built with a high degree of redundancy for reliability concern. Thus, it is very likely that there exist various network topologies that can deliver continuous power supply to consumers. The optimal transmission network topology could be very different for different system conditions. Transmission network topology control (TNTC) can provide the operator with an additional option to manage network congestion, reduce losses, relieve violation, and achieve cost saving. This paper examines the benefits of TNTC in reducing post-contingency overloads that are identified by real-time contingency analysis (RTCA). The procedure of RTCA with TNTC is presented and two algorithms are proposed to determine the candidate switching solutions. Both algorithms use available system data: sensitivity factors or shifting factors. The proposed two TNTC approaches are based on the transmission switching distribution factor (TSDF) and flow transfer distribution factor (FTDF) respectively. FTDF based TNTC approach is an enhanced version of TSDF based TNTC approach by considering network flow distribution. Numerical simulations demonstrate that both methods can effectively relieve flow violations and FTDF outperforms TSDF.

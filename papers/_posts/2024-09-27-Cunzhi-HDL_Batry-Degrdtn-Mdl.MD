# Abstract
Batteries can effectively improve the security of energy systems and mitigate climate change by facilitating wind and solar power. The installed capacity of battery energy storage system (BESS), mainly the lithium ion batteries are increasing significantly in recent years. However, the battery degradation cannot be accurately quantified and integrated into energy management system with existing heuristic battery degradation models. This paper proposed a hierarchical deep learning based battery degradation quantification (HDL-BDQ) model to quantify the battery degradation given scheduled BESS daily operations. Particularly, two sequential and cohesive deep neural networks are proposed to accurately estimate the degree of degradation using inputs of battery operational profiles and it can significantly outperform existing fixed or linear rate based degradation models as well as single-stage deep neural models. Training results show the high accuracy of the proposed system. Moreover, a learning and optimization decoupled algorithm is implemented to strategically take advantage of the proposed HDL-BDQ model in optimization-based look-ahead scheduling (LAS) problems. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HDL-BDQ model in LAS of a microgrid testbed.

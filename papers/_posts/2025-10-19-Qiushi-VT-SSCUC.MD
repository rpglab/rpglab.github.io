# Abstract
The rapid increase in renewable energy sources (RES) implementation in the power system requires the system to increase its transfer capacity at an equally fast pace. Deterministic optimization shows that BESS-based Virtual Transmission Line (VTL), as an alternative to physical transmission lines, can offer a quick solution for congestion relief, reduced operational costs, and lower RES curtailment. This study aims to evaluate the benefits of the VTL when considering RES uncertainty. Particularly, this work proposes a scenario-based stochastic security-constrained unit commitment model considering VTL, SSCUC-VTL. It incorporates the forecast error of RES into the commitment decision for systems with VTL. The performance of applying the VTL strategy is compared to that of adding a new physical transmission line and a standalone battery energy storage system (BESS). A case study has been conducted on an enhanced IEEE 24-bus test system. The simulation results demonstrate that VTL provides 23% more operational cost reduction than the physical transmission line, and up to 67% more congestion relief than the standalone BESS in a power system with solar and wind generation.

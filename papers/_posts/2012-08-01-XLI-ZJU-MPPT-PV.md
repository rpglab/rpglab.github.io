# Abstract

The double fuzzy control is proposed for the MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) of grid-connected photovoltaic generation system, which combines asymmetric fuzzy MPPT and fuzzy PID together. The conventional method such as perturbation-observation is replaced by the asymmetric fuzzy control in the reference voltage setting section and the general PID control is replaced by the fuzzy PID control in the actual-reference voltage deviation elimination section. Four MPPT performance indexes are proposed: tracing time when environment changes slowly, power output of photovoltaic array, steady-state power fluctuation, and power output of photovoltaic array when environment changes greatly. Four cases are designed and five control methods are respectively simulated in the environment of MATLAB / Simulink. The comparison of the indexes of MPPT performance and the waveform of output power verifies that, the proposed double fuzzy control method is better than the traditional methods.

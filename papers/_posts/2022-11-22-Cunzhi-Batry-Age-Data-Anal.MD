# Abstract
The installation capacity of energy storage system, especially the battery energy storage system (BESS), has increased significantly in recent years, which is mainly applied to mitigate the fluctuation caused by renewable energy sources (RES) due to the fast response and high round-trip energy efficiency of BESS. The main components of majority of BESSs are lithium-ion batteries, which will degrade during the BESS daily operation. Heuristic battery degradation models are proposed to consider the battery degradation in the operations of energy systems to optimize the scheduling. However, those heuristic models are not evaluated or demonstrated with real battery degradation data. Thus, this paper will perform a quality analysis on the popular heuristic battery degradation models using the real battery aging experiment data to evaluate their performance. A benchmark model is also proposed to represent the real battery degradation value based on the averaged cycle value of the experimental data.

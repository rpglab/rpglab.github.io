# Abstract

This paper presents a novel procedure for energy management system (EMS) that can utilize the flexibility in transmission network in a practical way. With the proposed enhanced EMS procedure, the reliability benefits that are provided by corrective transmission switching (CTS) in real-time contingency analysis (RTCA) can be translated into significant cost savings in real-time security-constrained economic dispatch (RT SCED). Simulation results show the congestion cost with consideration of CTS is largely reduced as CTS can relieve potential post-contingency network violations. The effects of integrating CTS in existing EMS procedure on markets are also analyzed. In conclusion, this two-part paper shows that CTS can achieve substantial reliability benefits, as well as significant cost savings.

# Abstract
There have been growing interests in integrating hydrogen storage into the power grids with high renewable penetration levels. The economic benefits and power grid reliability are both essential for the hydrogen storage integration. In this paper, an annual scheduling model (ASM) for energy hubs (EH) coupled power grids is proposed to investigate the annual benefits of the seasonal hydrogen storage (SHS). Each energy hub consists of the hydrogen storage, electrolyzers and fuel cells. The electrical and hydrogen energy can be exchanged on the bus with energy hub. The physical constraints for both grids and EHs are enforced in ASM. The proposed ASM considers the intra-season daily operation of the EH coupled grids. Four typical daily profiles are used in ASM to represent the grid conditions in four seasons, which reduces the computational burden. Besides, both the intra-season and cross-season hydrogen exchange and storage are modeled in the ASM. Hence, the utilization of hydrogen storage is optimized on a year-round level. Numerical simulations are conducted on the IEEE 24-bus system. The simulation results indicate that the seasonal hydrogen storage can effectively save the annual operation cost and reduce the renewable curtailments.

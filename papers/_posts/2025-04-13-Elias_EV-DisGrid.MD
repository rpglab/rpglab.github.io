# Abstract
To achieve net-zero carbon emissions, electrification in the transportation sector plays an important role. Significant increase of electric vehicles (EV) has been observed nationally and globally. While the transition to EVs presents substantial environmental benefits, it would lead to several challenges to the power grid due to EV charging activities. Growing EVs greatly increase peak loads on residential grids, particularly during evening charging periods. This surge can result in operational challenges, including greater voltage drops, increased power losses, and potential overloading violations, compromising grid reliability and efficiency. This study focuses on determining ampacity violations, and analyzing line loading levels in a 240-bus distribution system with 1120 customers, located in the Midwest U.S. By simulating a range of charging scenarios and evaluating EV chargers with varying power capacities under different distribution system voltage levels, this research aims to identify lines at risk of ampacity violations for various EV charging penetration rates up to 100%. The findings will provide valuable insights for utilities and grid operators, informing strategies for voltage level adjustments and necessary infrastructure reinforcements to effectively accommodate the growing energy demands associated with widespread EV adoption.

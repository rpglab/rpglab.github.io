# Abstract
Battery energy storage systems (BESS) play a pivotal role in future power systems as they contribute to achieving the net-zero carbon emission objectives. The BESS systems, predominantly employing lithium-ion batteries, have been extensively deployed. The degradation of these batteries significantly affects system efficiency. Deep neural networks can accurately quantify the battery degradation, however, the model complexity hinders their applications in energy scheduling for various power systems at different scales. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel approach, introducing a linearized sparse neural network-based battery degradation model (SNNBD), specifically tailored to quantify battery degradation based on the scheduled BESS daily operational profiles. By leveraging sparse neural networks, this approach achieves accurate degradation prediction while substantially reducing the complexity associated with a dense neural network model. The computational burden of integrating battery degradation into day-ahead energy scheduling is thus substantially alleviated. Case studies, conducted on both microgrids and bulk power grids, demonstrated the efficiency and suitability of the proposed SNNBD-integrated scheduling model that can effectively address battery degradation concerns while optimizing day-ahead energy scheduling operations.

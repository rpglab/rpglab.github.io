# Abstract

Security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) is solved for power system day-ahead generation scheduling, which is a large-scale mixed-integer linear programming problem and is very computationally intensive. Model reduction of SCUC may bring significant time savings. In this work, a novel approach is proposed to effectively utilize machine learning (ML) to reduce the problem size of SCUC. An ML model using logistic regression (LR) algorithm is proposed and trained with historical nodal demand profiles and the respective commitment schedules. The ML outputs are processed and analyzed to reduce variables and constraints in SCUC. The proposed approach is validated on several standard test systems including IEEE 24-bus system, IEEE 73-bus system, IEEE 118-bus system, synthetic South Carolina 500-bus system and Polish 2383-bus system. Simulation results demonstrate that the use of the prediction from the proposed LR model in SCUC model reduction can substantially reduce the computing time while maintaining solution quality.

# Abstract
Conventional synchronous generators are gradually being replaced by inverter-based resources. Such transition introduces more complicated operation conditions, and also imposes challenges for system operators on maintaining system frequency and rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF) security due to reduction in system inertia. To ensure the system wide frequency security, this paper presents an active rectified linear unit (ReLU) linearized neural network (ARLNN) based RoCoF-constrained unit commitment (ARLNN-RCUC) model. A predictor is first trained to predict the highest locational RoCoF based on a high-fidelity simulation dataset. Instead of incorporating the complete trained neural network into unit commitment, a ReLU linearization method is implemented on selected neurons to improve the algorithm efficiency. The effectiveness of proposed ARLNN-RCUC model is demonstrated on the IEEE 24-bus system by conducting time domain simulation on PSS/E.

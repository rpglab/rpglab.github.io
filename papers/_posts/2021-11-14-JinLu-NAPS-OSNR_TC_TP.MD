# Abstract

Power system restoration can be divided into three stages: black-start, network reconfiguration, and load restoration. A skeleton-network should be restored in the second stage to prepare for the subsequent large-scale system-wide load pickup. This paper proposes a novel integrated skeleton-network reconfiguration (ISNR) model which considers both the topological characteristics of the network and the transmission path energization constraints. A novel topological characteristics-based skeleton-network quality index (TCSNQI), an index based on the network importance and distance, is proposed to evaluate the quality of the skeleton-network. The proposed ISNR model can attain both the target network and the associated restoration sequence for that network. The attained target network reaches a certain quality level, and it requires the least restoration time based on the attained sequence of ordered switching actions. The proposed ISNR model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Numerical simulations on the New England 39-bus test system demonstrate the performance of the proposed ISNR model.

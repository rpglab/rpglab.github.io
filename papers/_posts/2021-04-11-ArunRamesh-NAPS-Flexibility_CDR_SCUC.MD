# Abstract
Currently, system operators implement demand response by dispatching controllable loads for economic reasons in day-ahead scheduling. Particularly, demand shifting from peak hours when the cost of electricity is higher to non-peak hours to maintain system reliability by flattening the load profile. However, the system flexibility and economic benefits of such action in post-contingency scenarios are not explicitly considered in short-term operations. Hence, this paper highlights the benefits of demand response as a corrective action for potential post-contingency emergencies in day-ahead scheduling. A security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model which considers the flexibility offered through corrective demand response (CDR) to maintain system reliability when a line or generator outage occurs is proposed. The proposed model was tested on IEEE 24-bus system where simulation results point to significant total cost savings in daily operations. Moreover, the results point to better long-term reliability of generators along with the ability to use existing system flexibility and serve higher critical demands in base-case when CDR is implemented.

# Abstract

In recent years, there has been significant growth ofd istributed energy resources (DERs) penetration in the power grid. The stochastic and intermittent features of variable DERs such as roof top photovoltaic (PV) bring substantial uncertainties to the grid on the consumer end and weaken the grid reliability. In addition, the fact that numerous DERs are widespread in the grid makes it hard to monitor and manage DERs. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel real-time grid-supporting energy management (GSEM) strategy for grid-supporting microgrid. This strategy can not only properly manage DERs in a
microgrid but also enable DERs to provide grid services, which enables a microgrid to be grid-supporting via flexible trading power. The proposed GSEM strategy is based on a 2-step optimization which includes a routine economic dispatch (ED) step and an acceptable trading power range determination step. Numerical simulations demonstrate the performance of the proposed GSEM strategy which enables the grid operator to have a dispatch choice of trading power with microgrid and enhance the reliability and resilience of the main grid.

# Abstract

Preventive maintenance is key to extending the lifetime of transmission lines and to avoiding unnecessary replacement costs. Maintenance forces transmission assets to be taken out of service temporarily, which changes the network topology and may influence the system security margin as well as the energy markets. Therefore, transmission outage coordination is very critical. While industry practices typically examine the reliability impacts of outage coordination, this paper evaluates the impacts on both reliability and market economics. The procedure of practical outage coordination is first introduced in this paper. The extensive formulation to co-optimize the outage scheduling problem and the day-ahead unit commitment problem is then presented. The complete formulation with an exact algorithm can guarantee the optimal solution but that comes at the cost of a long solution time. Four fast heuristics are examined in order to solve this complex mathematical program. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the four proposed heuristics. The solution time is significantly reduced while quality solutions are still obtained. The numerical results show that transmission outage coordination could have a great impact on the energy markets such as changes in LMP.

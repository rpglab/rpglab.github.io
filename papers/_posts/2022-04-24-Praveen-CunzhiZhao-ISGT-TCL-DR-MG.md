# Abstract

The flexible power consumption feature of thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) such as heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems makes them attractive targets for demand response (DR). TCLs possess a brief period where their power utilization can be altered without any significant impact on customer comfort level. This indicates TCLs are hidden potentials for providing ancillary services. This paper proposes a novel metric of demand response support time (DRST) for HVAC enabled demand response and a novel algorithm for the quantification of such HVAC-DR. The consumersâ€™ comfort will not be compromised with the proposed DRST-based HVAC-DR. Case studies demonstrate its benefits in terms of cost saving in microgrid day-ahead scheduling and reduction of forced load shedding during a grid-microgrid tie-line outage event. This illustrates the reserve potential benefits and the increase of microgrid reliability when DRST-based HVAC-DR is considered.

# Abstract

Renewable energy sources (RES) has gained a lot of interest recently. The limited transmission capacity serving RES often leads to network congestion since they are located in remote favorable locations. As a result, when poorly scheduled, the intermittent nature of RES may result in high curtailments of the free resource. Currently, grid operators utilize a static network when performing day-ahead scheduling and ignore transmission flexibility. This paper explores the possibility of utilizing network reconfiguration as a corrective action to reduce the transmission congestion and thereby the reduction of RES curtailments in dayahead scheduling. To facilitate the RES integration in the grid, a stochastic N-1 security-constrained unit-commitment with corrective network reconfiguration (SSCUC-CNR) is modelled. SSCUC-CNR model is studied on a modified IEEE 24-bus system with RES. The simulation results demonstrates that CNR not only leads to a lower cost solution by reducing network congestion but also facilitates RES integration by reducing congestion-induced curtailments in high penetration cases. Emission studies demonstrate that more green generators are committed resulting in reduced carbon emissions when CNR is implemented

# Abstract
The aim of distribution networks is to meet their local area power demand with maximum reliability. As the electricity consumption tends to increase every year, limited line thermal capacity can lead to network congestion. Continuous development and upgradation of the distribution network is thus required to meet the energy demand, which poses a significant increase in cost. The objective of this research is to analyze distribution network topologies and introduce a topology reconfiguration scheme based on the cost and demand of electricity. Traditional electrical distribution networks are static and inefficient. To make the network active, an optimal dynamic network topology reconfiguration (DNTR) is proposed to control line switching and reconnect some loads to different substations such that the cost of electricity can be minimized. The proposed DNTR strategy was tested on a synthetic radial distribution network with three substations each connecting to an IEEE 13-bus system. Simulation results demonstrated significant cost saving in daily operations of this distribution system.

# Abstract
As NASA prepares to carry out its Artemis lunar missions, the design and planning of robust power systems tailored to the lunar environment become necessary and urgent. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are among the most suitable power generators for lunar applications given the abundant solar irradiance the lunar surface receives as a result of the lack of an atmosphere. However, the vastly different environmental conditions of the moon compared to those on Earth call for special reconsiderations to the traditional PV power output models used for terrestrial applications. The substantially wider range of temperatures on the moon combined with the absence of atmosphere implies the PV will operate at very different thermal conditions. Therefore, this paper proposes a PV power output model that determines PV cell temperature on the lunar surface based on lunar ambient temperature as well as solar irradiance, while also capturing these special lunar conditions. The model is based on thermal exchange via the three main heat transfer paths: heat radiation, absorption, and convection. Moreover, four different array configurations are presented and compared to determine the most suitable choice based on energy generation and complexity for different locations around the moon.

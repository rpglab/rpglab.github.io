# Abstract

Making full use of wind power is one of the main purposes of the wind turbine generator control. Conventional hill climbing search (HCS) method can realize the maximum power point tracking (MPPT). However, the step size of HCS method is constant so that it cannot consider both steady-state response and dynamic response. A fuzzy logical control (FLC) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem in this paper, which can track the maximum power point (MPP) quickly and smoothly. To evaluate MPPT algorithms, four performance indices are also proposed in this paper. They are the energy captured by wind turbine, the maximum power-point tracking time when wind speed changes slowly, the fluctuation magnitude of real power during steady state, and the energy captured by wind turbine when wind speed changes fast. Three cases are designed and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink respectively. The comparison of the three MPPT strategies concludes that the proposed fuzzy logical control algorithm is more superior to the conventional HCS algorithms.

# Abstract

This paper presents a general fault location method for large transmission networks which uses phasor measurement unit (PMU) voltage measurements where the injected current at a fault point can be calculated by using the voltage change and its relevant transfer impedance on any bus. A two-stage fault location optimization model is proposed, along with defining a matching degree index. The first stage is the fault region identification stage, which uses the matching degree index to determine the suspicious fault region in order to reduce the search area. The second stage is used to identify the exact fault line and fault distance. A method to determine optimal PMU placement is also proposed in this paper. Case studies verify that the proposed fault location algorithm and optimal PMU placement scheme can locate faults in large transmission networks quickly and accurately without requiring fault type classification or fault phase selection.

# Abstract

Despite the significant attention transmission switching (TS) has gained over the last decade, important challenges remain. This paper addresses the state of the art challenges of transmission switching by studying the benefits of corrective switching using authentic ISO-NE data and software. Thus, the results and analyses presented in this paper are more convincing than any other study conducted to date. Transmission switching is successfully implemented for reliability applications as a corrective mechanism. ISO-NE maintains N-1 reliability based on preventive dispatch and enforcing proxy reserve requirements along with N-1-1 reliability based on reserves and interface limits. This paper incorporates transmission switching as a corrective mechanism in response to both N-1 and N-1-1 events. Not only does the paper investigate the capability of corrective switching to alleviate thermal overloads, but also the economic benefits of corrective switching with actual market data and in-house market software at ISO-NE. The results show that corrective transmission switching can improve the reliability of the system and save millions of dollars each year by providing a cheaper corrective action alternative for ISO-NE. The results also suggest that transmission switching would provide more significant benefits for systems with more transmission congestion such as PJM, MISO, and ERCOT.

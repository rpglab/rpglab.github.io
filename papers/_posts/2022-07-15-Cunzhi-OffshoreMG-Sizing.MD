# Abstract
The total electricity consumption from offshore oil/gas platforms is around 16 TWh worldwide in 2019. The majority offshore platforms are powered by the diesel generators while the rest mainly uses gas turbines, which emits large amounts of CO2 per year. The fast development of offshore wind turbines (WT) can potentially replace traditional fossil fuel based resources to power offshore loads. Thus, a novel offshore hybrid renewable energy sources (OHRES) system is proposed to enable a zero CO2 emission offshore platform mitigating climate change. Battery energy storage system (BESS) and hydrogen energy storage system (HESS) are considered to mitigate the fluctuation of wind power in the proposed OHRES system. Resilience models are designed to enhance the resilience of the proposed OHRES system with extra energy stored in BESS and/or HESS. Case studies demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed OHRES system to power offshore platforms. The economic analysis reports the planning cost for the proposed OHRES system under different resilience levels, which may benefit the decision to balance the carbon emission and investment cost.

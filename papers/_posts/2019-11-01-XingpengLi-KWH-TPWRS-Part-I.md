# Abstract

The flexibility in transmission networks is not fully utilized in existing energy management systems (EMSs). Corrective transmission switching (CTS) is proposed in this two-part paper to enable EMS to take advantage of the flexibility in transmission systems in a practical way. This paper proposes two EMS procedures: 1) Procedure-A connects real-time security-constrained economic dispatch (RT SCED) with real-time contingency analysis (RTCA), which is consistent with industrial practice; 2) Procedure-B, an enhanced version of Procedure-A, includes CTS in EMS with the proposed concept of branch pseudo limit used in RT SCED. Part-I of this paper presents the methodology while Part-II includes detailed results analysis. It is demonstrated that Procedure-A can effectively eliminate the base case overloads and the potential post-contingency overloads identified by RTCA and Procedure-B can achieve significant congestion cost reduction with consideration of CTS in RT SCED. Numerical simulations also illustrate that integrating CTS into RT SCED would improve social welfare.

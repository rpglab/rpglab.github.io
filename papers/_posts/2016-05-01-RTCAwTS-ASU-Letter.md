# Abstract

Transmission switching (TS) has shown to be an effective power flow control tool.  TS can reduce the system cost, improve system reliability, and enhance the management of intermittent renewable resources. This paper addresses the state of the art problem of TS by developing an AC-based real-time contingency analysis (RTCA) package with TS. The package is tested on real power system data, taken from energy management systems of PJM, TVA, and ERCOT. The results show that post-contingency corrective switching is a ready to be implemented transformational technology that provides substantial reliability gains. The computational time and the performance of the developed RTCA package, reported in the paper, are promising.

# Abstract

Transmission switching (TS) has gained significant attention recently. However, barriers still remain and must be overcome before the technology can be adopted by the industry. The state of the art challenges include AC feasibility, computational complexity, the ability to handle large-scale real power systems, and dynamic stability. This paper investigates these challenges by developing an AC corrective TS (CTS) based real-time contingency analysis (RTCA) tool that can handle large-scale systems within a reasonable time. The tool quickly proposes multiple high quality corrective switching actions for contingencies with potential violations. To reduce the computational complexity, three heuristic algorithms are proposed to generate a small set of candidate switching actions. Parallel computing is implemented to further speed up the solution time. Moreover, time-domain simulations are performed to check for dynamic stability of the proposed CTS solutions. The promising results, tested on the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) system and actual energy management system (EMS) snapshots from the PJM Interconnection (PJM) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), show that the tool effectively reduces post-contingency violations. It is concluded that CTS is ripe for industry adoption for RTCA application.

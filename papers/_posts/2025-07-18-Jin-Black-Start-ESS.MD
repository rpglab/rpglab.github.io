# Abstract
With the increasing integration of renewable energy, the reliability and resilience of modern power systems are of vital significance. However, large-scale blackouts caused by natural disasters or equipment failures remain a significant threat, necessitating effective restoration strategies. This study proposes novel black start models for modern power systems that integrate fuel cells and battery storage, recognizing their distinct characteristics and contributions to grid resilience. These models specifically address the restoration of electrical grids, including the energization paths and time of the transmission network, while accounting for the unique power output traits of fuel cells and the energy storage capacity of batteries as black start resources. Black start simulations, comparing the generator startup sequence (GSUS) with fuel cell versus battery systems, are performed on the IEEE 39-bus system. We conduct sensitivity analyses on fuel cell capacity, battery storage capacity, initial state of charge (SOC), and resource locations to identify optimal scenarios for black start operations.

# Abstract

Standalone wind-solar-storage power supply system is an effective way to solve the problem of power supply in remote areas Proper combination of distributed generation in a power supply system is a key problem for its reliability and economy. Based on system components modeling the economic model of optimal sizing was built with the objective of minimal annualized cost of system while considering the system operating constraints. The numerical solution based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is worked out. In case study, battery and electrolyzer-hydrogen tank-fuel cell circulatory system are put as storage devices respectively, optimal sizing results with different storage modes are analyzed comparatively. Case study results show that the optimal sizing for wind/solar/battery is more economical on condition of meeting the same power supply reliability and it is concluded that reasonable outage cost assessment and reliability index setting can effectively reduce the redundant investment of system.

# Abstract
The rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) adoption poses operational and economic challenges for power distribution systems, including increased line loading levels and network congestions. This may require potential infrastructure reinforcement and expansion. As a fast inexpensive alternative solution, network topology reconfiguration (NTR) offers a practical means to redistribute power flows, reduce operational costs, and defer infrastructure upgrades. This paper presents a linear programming framework to evaluate the impact of varying EV penetration on operational costs under four configurations: standard distribution network (SDN), SDN with NTR (SDNTR), SDN with distributed energy resources (SDN-DER), and SDNTR with DERs (SDNTR-DER). Numerical simulations are conducted on the IEEE 33-bus system. The analysis demonstrates that integrating DERs reduces operational costs, while NTR further enhances system flexibility, enabling higher EV penetration levels without compromising feasibility. The combined SDNTR-DER approach offers the most cost-effective and reliable pathway for accommodating future EV growth while mitigating the need for immediate infrastructure upgrades.

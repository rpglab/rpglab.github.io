# Abstract
The increasing interest in hydrogen as a clean energy source has led to extensive research into its transmission, storage, and integration with bulk power systems. With the evolution of hydrogen technologies towards greater efficiency, and cost-effectiveness, it becomes essential to examine the operation and expansion of grids that include both electric power and hydrogen facilities. This paper introduces an expansion strategy for electric power and hydrogen transmission systems, tailored for future renewable energy-enriched grids. Our proposed transmission expansion planning with hydrogen facilities (TEP-H) model integrates daily operations of both electric power and hydrogen transmissions. The fuel cells and electrolyzers are used for electrical-hydrogen energy conversion, and related constraints are considered in TEP-H. We applied TEP-H to the Texas 123-bus backbone transmission grid (TX-123BT), for various renewable penetration levels and hydrogen technology development assumptions. It gave us insights on the scenarios that hydrogen transmission become feasible and economically beneficial. We also compared the performance of TX-123BT system with the hybrid transmission investment and the pure electrical transmission investment obtained by a traditional transmission expansion planning (TEP-T) model. The numerical results indicate that future renewable grids can have lower total cost with TEP-H if future electrical-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency is high.

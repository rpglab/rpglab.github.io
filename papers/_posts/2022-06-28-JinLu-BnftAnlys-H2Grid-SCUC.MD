# Abstract
The curtailment of renewable energy is more frequently observed as the renewable penetration levels are rising rapidly in modern power systems. It is a waste of free and green renewable energy and implies current power grids are unable to accommodate more renewable sources. One major reason is that higher power transmission capacity is required for higher renewable penetration level. Another major reason is the volatility of the renewable generation. The hydrogen mix or pure hydrogen pipeline can both transfer and store the energy in the form of hydrogen. However, its potential of accelerating renewable integration has not been investigated. In this paper, hydrogen pipeline networks, combined with power-to-hydrogen (P2H) and hydrogen-to-power (H2P) facilities, are organized to form a Hydrogen Energy Transmission and Conversion System (HETCS). We investigate the operation of power systems coupled with HETCS, and propose the day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) with HETCS. The SCUC simulation is conducted on a modified IEEE 24-bus power system with HETCS. Simulation results show HETCS can substantially reduce the renewable curtailment, CO2 emission, load payment and total operational cost. This study validates the HETCS can be a promising solution to achieve net-zero renewable grids.

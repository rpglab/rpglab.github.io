"During my internship in ERCOT during summer 2025, I interned with the Operations Stability Analysis Grup, where I worked on improving the management and format processing of the dynamic model files (.dyr) used for Transient Stability Analysis Tools (TSAT) of DSATools. My internship project focused on enhancing the automation and flexibility with which these DYR files are handled, which define dynamic behavior for transient stability simulatons. I primarily developed python-based tools that communicated with a centralized SQL database for automated conversion and creation of tailored dynamic files involving different generation sites in the ERCOT grid, handling the correct bus IDs and name-based identifiers to ensure compatibility with TSAT.

The database integrated generator metadata such as location, generator type, power capacity, interconnection voltage level, and model parameters, allowing for easier updates and information requests. Additionally, I created user-friendly interfaces for data querying, editing, and generation of custom DYR model files."

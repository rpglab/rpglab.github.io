* Our new research project is entitled "NASA Lunar Power Systems".

* This project is jointly sponsored by National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA) and CenterPoint Energy (CNP) through Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).

* We had the kick-off meeting at a CNP building in Houston on November 9, 2022.

* The UH team consists of <a href="/people/Xingpeng-Li" class="off">Dr. Xingpeng Li (power systems)</a> and Dr. Harish Krishnamoorthy (power electronics and conversion) from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at UH.

* The available funding to the University of Houston from this project is $96,000.

* The ultimate goal of this project is to design a practical lunar power system - a power system supplying reliable power to support future activities on the Lunar.

* We will meet routinely with the technical staff from NASA, CNP and EPRI, once every two weeks.

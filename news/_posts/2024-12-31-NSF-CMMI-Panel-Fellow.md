* I am honored to be part of the 2024 cohort of NSF-CMMI’s Game Changer Academies for Advancing Research Innovation. 

* Throughout the Fall semester of 2024, I completed the CMMI Game Changer Academies Panel Fellow program, organized by the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI), Directorate for Engineering, the National Science Foundation (NSF). 

* I received a CERTIFICATE OF ACHIEVEMENT from the NSF CMMI Division, which recognizes me as a CMMI Panel Fellow for demonstrated commitment to deliberative democracy in panel reviews. 

* CMMI’s Game Changer Academies (C-GCA) prepares Panel Fellows to enact NSF’s core values by demonstrating scientific leadership to advance innovation and collaboration.

* C-GCA 2024 is a 12-week professional development program for individuals who are eligible to serve on panels for the CMMI division at NSF. I devoted approximately 25 hours including 6 live 90-minute interactive virtual sessions (every other Friday, Sept 6-Nov 15) and related asynchronous preparation for each session.

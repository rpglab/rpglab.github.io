* Congratulations to ALL the 4 UH team members for receiving the Recognition of Excellence from NASA. 

* The UH team here is meant for a team of UH researchers contributing to a NASA project aiming to design a lunar surface power system with high reliability and resilience considering the unique lunar environment, in support of the Artemis program.

* The UH team includes:

	(i) two power system researchers: <a target="_blank" href="/people/Xingpeng-Li/" class="">Dr. Xingpeng Li</a> and <a target="_blank" href="/people/Jesus-SilvaRodriguez/" class="">Jesus Silva-Rodriguez</a>, from the RPG Lab; 

	(ii) two power electronics researchers: Dr. Harish Krishnamoorthy and Rahul Raj.

* This NASA visit was initially planned for the last Fall but rescheduled to this January due to schedule conflicts. 

* This visit included a 2-hour tour to the NASA facilities and research work, followed by a 1-hour presentation summarizing our project work.

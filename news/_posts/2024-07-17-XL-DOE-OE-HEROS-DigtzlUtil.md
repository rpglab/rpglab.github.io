* Our lab is selected as a Phase-I Data Track winner for the Digitizing Utilities Prize (Round 2) competition program launched by U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Electricity (OE). Phase-I cash/prize award amount: $75,000. 

* Out of 299 teams (per Heros submission site data), 9 teams were selected and awarded $75,000 in cash prizes each for their efforts in the Utility Digitization/Data Challenge track (Track 1). Among the 9 selected teams, only 2 teams including our team are from the Academia.

* Watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMXvnn8ZMJw" class="" target="_blank">90-second video</a> for an overview of our proposed solution.

* The short Entry title: EV load-accelerated Cable Failure and Replacement.

* Our Utility Partner: CenterPoint Energy (CNP).

* Summary of proposed work: "This team plans to develop a data-driven proactive cable replacement method, aiming to address CNPâ€™s concern on accelerated cable degradation and failure due to fast-growing EVs. Particularly, they will focus on projecting EV adoption rate and estimate future load profiles, as well as predicting cable remaining useful life (RUL) and estimating when the cable would fail and must be replaced."

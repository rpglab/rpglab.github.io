* On April 2, 2025, I was invited to attend CNP's University Collaboration Luncheon. 

* Four CNP VPs shared their visions and strategic plans. I shared our group's research focuses and our UH Extend program, as well as briefly introduced the Power Engineering courses we offer at UH-ECE. Meaningful conversations around workforce development, curriculum alignment, and building stronger partnerships between academia and the utility industry.

* It was a great event to further enhance our collaborations with our local utility CNP serving the Greater Houston region, and also a great opportunity to meet peer professors at other neighbor universities.

* Congratulations to <a href="/people/Xingpeng-Li" class="off">Xingpeng Li</a> for being selected as a _Finalist_ for the <a class="" href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/programs/igniite" target="_blank">ARPA-E IGNIITE Program</a>, which is a single-PI early-career award program. Researchers from academia, national labs or the industry can apply as long as they meet the eligibility requirements. 

* Our Proposal Title: "Dynamics-Constrained Energy Management Systems"

* In total, 49 finalists were selected and invited to attend the pitch session in Washington D.C. on March 6, 2024. 

* Roughly, 20 finalists will be selected for award (each selectee will receive $500,000). The winning/success rate among finalists is slightly over 40% at this stage.

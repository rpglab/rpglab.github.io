Dr. Xingpeng Li had a TV Interview with ABC13 this morning on October 9, 2023. Dr. Li discussed the impact of upcoming solar eclipse (October 14, 2023) on the Texas power grid.

Dr. Li was not very worried about the power supply in Texas during the solar eclipse, since it coincides with cooler weather in Texas. However, if it occurred on a scorching summer day, it could lead to major power outages due to insufficient generation capacity.

* As an invited General Participate, I attended the 2024 USFOE during September 11-14 at the National Academiesâ€™ Beckman Center in Irvine, California. 

* There were seventy-six (76) highly accomplished early-career engineers that was selected to participate in the 2024 The Grainger Foundation Frontiers of Engineering Symposium, a signature activity of NAE. 

* Dr. John Anderson, the President of the National Academy of Engineering, gave an opening speech and joined us for the entire symposium.

* It was a great event to get to know experts in other areas and expand our professional network.

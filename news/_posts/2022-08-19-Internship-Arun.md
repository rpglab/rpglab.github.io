In Summer 2022, Arun interned with National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) on a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) microgrid controller (MGC) for distribution networks. The objective of the P2P energy management system (EMS) is to coordinate the microgrids in a distributed fashion while achieving certain network objectives. In this milestone, they investigated how the communication network connectivity using a fully connected and partially connected communication graph between the MGC affects the performance of the P2P EMS algorithm. The customer for this work is Siemens and the data system is Holy Cross Energy HV+LV utility data with 5 feeders. An offline tool was developed with Python coding, and OpenDSS whereas an online tool was developed using HELICS co-simulation platform.

In Summer 2021, Arun interned with Electric Power Research institute (EPRI) to consult on studies for multiple DOE projects. Project 1 studied the flexibility reserves utilized to address the uncertainty in load or solar forecast. These reserves are held in day-ahead operations and used in real-time. The zonal and system flexibility reserve requirement were estimated through probabilistic forecasts (uses historical and/or forecast data) but in a deterministic manner to provide a computational advantage compared to stochastic optimization. Project 2 involved the valuation of Pumped Storage Hydro (PSH) resources in energy and operating reserve provisions for a month-long case study. Constraint development considered the PSH block loaded characteristics in pumping mode and prevent simultaneous operation of generation and pumps modes using linear constraints. The energy production cost studies were implemented through Polarisâ€™ Power System Optimizer (PSO) whereas the probabilistic flexibility requirements were calculated using in-house developed tool, Dynador, and case studies were formed with cost saving benefits.

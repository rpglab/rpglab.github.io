* Five of us attended the DTECH 2025 conference in Dallas, TX, in March 2025: Jesus Silva-Rodriguez, Ann Mary Toms, Fan Jiang, Linhan Fang, and Xingpeng Li.

* It is a very large conference compared to the academic conferences we often attend.

* Majority attendees are from the industry. It is a very good industry-oriented conference to learn about the focuses of the power industry, which are very different from academic research focuses.

* On July 10, 2025, two colleagues (Professor Mike Harold, and Professor Lihong Zhao) and I visited TerraFlow Energy and learned their flow battery systems for supporting date centers and grid reliability. 

* It was exciting to learn their 50kW sandbox test environment, how they tackle some challenges in long-duration storage and grid reliability, and how they would leverage flow battery for supporting data centers.

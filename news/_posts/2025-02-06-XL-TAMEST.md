* As an invited Protégé, I attended the 2025 TAMEST Annual Meeting in February, 2025. 

* Through the TAMEST Protégé program, I shared my research with the general audience in the dedicated poster session. Many of them are senior researchers like NAE members, NAS members and even Nobel Prize recipient (know as Laureate).

* News article: <a class="" href="https://tamest.org/news/tamest-welcomes-2025-protege-class/" target="_blank">TAMEST Welcomes 2025 Protégé Class</a>. TAMEST is pleased to welcome 62 talented early-career researchers...

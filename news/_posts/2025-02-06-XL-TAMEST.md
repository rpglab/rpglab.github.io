* As an invited Protégé, I attended the 2025 TAMEST Annual Meeting in February, 2025. 

* Through the TAMEST Protégé program, I shared my research with the general audience in the dedicated poster session. Many of them are senior researchers like NAE members, NAS members and even Nobel Prize recipient (know as Laureate).

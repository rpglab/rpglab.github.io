This repo implements three different Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) models in AMPL. The test case used here is a modified IEEE 24-bus system; but these codes can work on any other systems.

(i) Model 1, TEP, a normal TEP model that is used as a Benchmark here.

(ii) Model 2, TEP w. SNO ("TEP-SNO-T1"), this TEP model optimizes the network topology for each season in the planning horizon. In this model, the status of new lines is NOT optimized. In other words, a new line, once it is constructed, is always considered to be in the network for all subsequent seasons.

(iii) Model 3, TEP w. Enhanced SNO ("TEP-SNO-T2"), this TEP model optimizes the network topology for each season in the planning horizon. In this model, the status of new lines is also optimized. In other words, a new line can be disconnected from the network for the subsequent seasons after its construction.

For simulation results provided here were obtained with the following computer: Intel Xeon W-2195 2.3GHz, 4.3GHz Turbo, 18C, 24.75M Cache, HT, (140W) DDR4-2666; 128GB (8x16GB) DDR4 2666MHz RDIMM ECC; M.2 512GB PCIe NVMe Class 40 Solid State Drive.

The following paper provides more details about these three models:

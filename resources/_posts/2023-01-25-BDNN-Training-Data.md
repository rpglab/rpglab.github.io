## Battery Degradation Neural Network

This resource page includes the dataset used to train a battery degradation neural network model, as well as the associated python code.


### File Description
* 'DNN.py' is designed to train a deep neural network model to predict the battery degradation value.
* 'BatteryData_Sample.xlsx' is a sample battery data that collected processed from matlab. which is also the input for the 'readtestdata_size.py'
* 'readtestdata_size.py' is designed to process the data from the excel and pack the data into x_sample,y_sample,x_test,y_test.
* 'x_sample.npy, y_sample.npy, x_test.npy, y_test.npy' are the tranining datas already attached. Normally it is the output of 'readtestdata_size.py'


### Environment (Python packages)
* torch
* numpy
* matplotlib
* os

Note the if you have a cuda supported GPU, we highly suggest you to install the cuda package to speed the training process.  https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

In our case, the training time is reduced by six times than non-cuda involved traning. 

The code is comaptiable with both GPU training and CPU traing (non-cuda).


### Input Parameters:
* file = 'xxxxxxxxx.xlsx'
* sample_num = how many battery aging tests for training dataset.
* cycle_num = how many cycles for each aging tests.
* feature_num = number of input features
* test_num = how many battery aging tests for testing dataset
* seq_length = cycle_num  
* BATCH_SIZE = trainig batch size
* epoches = traning epoches
* training_num = total number of traning data cell
* validation_num = total number of validation data cell

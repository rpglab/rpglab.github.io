# SOPF
This repo implements four different Stochastic Optimal Power Flow (SOPF) models in AMPL. The test case used here is a modified IEEE 24-bus system; but these codes can work on any other systems.

(i) Model 1, R-SOPF, a relaxed SOPF model that assums infinite network capacity.

(ii) Model 2, N-SOPF, a normal SOPF model that enforces base-case network constraints only.

(iii) Model 3, E-SOPF, a N-1 SOPF model that enforces both base-case network constraints and contingency-case network constraints.

(iv) Model 4, E-SOPFwNR, a N-1 SOPF w. CTS model that implements corrective transmission switching in post-contingency cases beyong the N-1 SOPF model.

For the most complex model (E-SOPFwNR), the code takes 130 seconds (~2 minutes) on a laptop: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8850H CPU @ 2.60GHz, 32 GB RAM, Windows 10.

The following paper provides more details about these four models:

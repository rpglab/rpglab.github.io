## Overview
This procedure is for power system stability simulations (under fault) using PSS/E. 

PSS/E version 33 is used as example, as well a standard 2-area 6-bus 5-branch test system.

Instructions of one following tip are also provided:
* A very efficient and helpful tip if we have to do it using the same process but with different fault clearing time again and again: is to use the I/O control recorder functionality.

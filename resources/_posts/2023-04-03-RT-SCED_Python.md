## RT-SCED
This set of codes implements real-time security-constrained economic dispatch (RT-SCED). It aims to provide a benchmark that mimics the commercial RT-SCED tool used by the Independent System Operators (ISO).

Code environment: Python2

Details are provided in the document "SCED_Manual_Developer_version.pdf" that is also available in the same github repository.

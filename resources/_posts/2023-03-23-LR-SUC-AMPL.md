## LR Stochastic SCUC
This set of codes implements Lagrangian Relaxation to solve the the stochastic unit commitment problem. This problem considers two types of generators: (i) slow generators that cannot change their on/off status in real-time; (ii) fast generators that can change their on/off status in real-time. Note that the network capacity constraints (branch thermal limits) are not considered in this work, which is an improvement to be made in the future.


Test systems:
* The test cases used here include (i) a modified IEEE RTS-96 reliability test system (73-bus). The reference is: "The IEEE Reliability Test System-1996. A report prepared by the Reliability Test System Task Force of the Application of Probability Methods Subcommittee" and link is <a class="" target="_blank" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/780914">here</a>.

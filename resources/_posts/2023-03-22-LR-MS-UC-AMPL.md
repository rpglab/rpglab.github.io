## LR G-T MSUC
This set of codes implements Lagrangian Relaxation to solve the coordinated Generation and Transmission Maintenance Scheduling problem. It is a complex optimization model that extends a normal security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) formulation.

Test systems:
* The test cases used here include (i) a modified IEEE RTS-96 reliability test system (73-bus) and (ii) one out of the three area system (24-bus). The reference is: "The IEEE Reliability Test System-1996. A report prepared by the Reliability Test System Task Force of the Application of Probability Methods Subcommittee" and link is <a class="" target="_blank" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/780914">here</a>.

## AMPL Codes for Examples in ECE6327 SGS
This repo provides about 40 AMPL programs, including codes for tutorial-level examples and codes for course-level DCOPF, SCUC, DSM, SUC, transmission switching, FACTS, energy storage, and microgrid energy management and sizing examples that are used for the class ECE6327 Smart Grid Systems at University of Houston for 2022 Spring.

This repo is part of the open source materials for the following course taught by Dr. Xingpeng Li.
* *<a class="off" href="/resources/ECE6327-SGS/" target="_blank">ECE6327 Smart Grid Systems (SGS)</a>* at University of Houston for 2022 Spring

Multiple ML models are implemented for ERCOT short-term load forecasting, using weather and time features.

### ML Models:
* Fully-connected neural network (FCNN)
* Support vector machine (SVM)
* Long short-term memory (LSTM)
* Long-term recurrent convolutional network (LRCN)

Multiple variations of the above ML models are trained and evaluated.


### Input Features:
* Weather information
	* temperature
	* long-wave radiation
	* short-wave radiation
	* wind speed
* Time information
	* hour-of-the-day
	* day-of-the-month
	* month-of-the-year


### Data Sources:
Raw ERCOT load data are from ERCOT website: https://www.ercot.com/

Raw weather data are from the Phase 2 of the North American Lan Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2).

Please refer to the paper below for more details about the data sources.

## Texas 123-bus Backbone Power System

This dataset represents a synthetic Texas 123-bus Backbone Transmission System (TX-123BT) with climate-dependent spatio-temporal correlated profiles (of solar power, wind power, load, and line thermal rating) at 1-hour resolution for the entire year of 2019. 

The procedures and details used to create TX-123BT system are described in our paper listed below.


### Introduction:
* The TX-123BT system has similar temporal and spatial characteristics as the actual Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) system.
* TX-123BT system has a backbone network consisting of only high-voltage transmission lines distributed in the Texas territory.
* It includes time series profiles of renewable generation, electrical load, and transmission thermal limits for the entire year of 2019.
* The North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) climate data is extracted and used to create the climate-dependent time series profiles mentioned above.  
* Two sets of climate-dependent dynamic line rating (DLR) profiles are created: (i) daily DLR and (ii) hourly DLR. 

### Power system configuration data:
* 'Bus_data.csv': Bus data including bus name and location (longitude & latitude).
* 'Line_data.csv': Line capacity and terminal bus information.
* 'Generator_data.xlsx': 
    * 'Gen_data' sheet: Generator parameters including active/reactive capacity, fuel type, cost and ramping rate.
	* 'Solar Plant Number' sheet: Correspondence between the solar plant number and generator number.
	* 'Wind Plant Number' sheet: Correspondence between the wind plant number and generator number.

### Time series profiles:
* 'Climate_2019' folder: Include each day's climate data for solar radiation, air temperature, wind speed near surface.
			     Each file in the folder includes the hourly temperature, longwave & shortwave solar radiation, zonal & Meridional wind speed data of a day in 2019.
* 'dynamic_rating_2019' folder: Include the hourly dynamic line rating for each day in 2019.
					Each file includes the hourly line rating (MW) of a line for all hours in 2019.
					In each file, columns represent hour 1-24 in a day, rows represent day 1-365 in 2019.    
* 'Daily_rating_2019.csv': The daily dynamic line rating (MW) for all lines and all days in 2019.
* 'solar_2019' folder: Solar production for all the solar farms in the TX-123BT and for all the days in 2019.
			   Each file includes the hourly solar production (MW) of all the solar plants for a day in 2019.
			   In each file, columns represent hour 1-24 in a day, rows represent solar plant 1-72. 
* 'wind_2019' folder: Wind production for all the wind farms in the case and for all the days in 2019.
			  Each file includes the hourly wind production (MW) of all the wind plants for a day in 2019.
			  In each file, columns represent hour 1-24 in a day, rows represent wind plant 1-82. 
* 'load_2019' folder: Include each day's hourly load data on all the buses.
			  Each file includes the hourly nodal loads (MW) of all the buses in a day in 2019.
 			  In each file,columns represent bus 1-123, rows represent hour 1-24 in a day.

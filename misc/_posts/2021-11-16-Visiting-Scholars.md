      <p>
We welcome visiting scholars who would like to visit our lab and conduct cutting-edge research here at the University of Houston. We typically do not take self-funded visiting scholars. Instead, scholars including faculties and students with similar research background who have secured or plan to apply for funding from their own university or government are welcome to send email queries.

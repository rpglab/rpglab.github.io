## Renewable Power Grid (RPG)

<div class="smallhead mb-1" style="font-size:18px;">
      <p>
As the electricity generation from renewable resources are growing significantly in recent years, it brings great benefits such as substantial CO2 emission reduction as well as grand challenges to the power grid. Our overall research goal is to promote renewable energy-enriched power grids, i.e. future Renewable Power Grids (RPG). Particularly, we explore various methods and research topics from different perspectives to facilitate the grid integration of renewable energy while ensuring the renewable power grid is efficient, reliable and resilient!

Our college provides <a class="" href="https://www.egr.uh.edu/academics/graduate-programs-policies/graduate-tuition-fellowships-gtf" target="_blank">GRADUATE TUITION FELLOWSHIPS (GTF)</a>. The time limit for GTF for a student entering the Ph.D. program at UH with a Master’s degree is 4 academic years. Students entering the Ph.D. program directly after a baccalaureate program cannot qualify for the GTF for more than 5 academic years.

The GTF offered by the College of Engineering at UH is very attractive for prospective students who work in the industry but want to pursue a doctoral degree. It is also very attractive for prospective students who receive external funding that can only cover the living expense.

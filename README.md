# Renewable Power Grid (RPG)
As the electricity generation from renewable resources are growing significantly in recent years, it brings great benefits such as substantial CO2 emission reduction as well as grand challenges to the power grid. Our overall research goal is to promote renewable energy-enriched power grids, i.e. future Renewable Power Grids (RPG). Particularly, we explore various methods and research topics from different perspectives to facilitate the grid integration of renewable energy while ensuring the renewable power grid is efficient, reliable and resilient!

# RPG Lab
The RPG Lab led by Dr. Xingpeng Li at the University of Houston conducts cutting-edge cross-discipline research focusing on bulk power systems and microgrids. Sophisticated high-performance methods in the areas of optimization, network science, data science and machine learning are leveraged to advance power energy systems and promote future renewable power grids.

The RPG Lab website is: https://rpglab.github.io

# Purpose
This website is created as a platform to showcase our research work from the RPG Lab. The People page lists all team members including alumni of the RPG Lab; each member has a unique profile webpage. The Publication page lists all our published papers as well as papers that are under review. We also share the data and codes we created, which are made publicly available and summarized in the Resources paper. We also have a Blog page for news and life beyond research.


# Acknowledgment

Our website is built upon the webpage designed by Dr. Trevor Bedford. We downloaded and modified their source codes (available at https://github.com/blab/blotter) that they use for the Bedford Lab's website. Their 'about' page (https://bedford.io/misc/about/) has more information about their source code.

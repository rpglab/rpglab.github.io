It was a great experience to interact with talent middle and high school students at the 8th Annual Harmony Science and Engineering Fair (H-SEF) 2022 at the Harmony Public Schools Central Office in Houston. H-SEF is an annual science fair that brings together middle and high school students across the Harmony network who have engaged in advanced research projects all year long.

Today's event is the final competition of H-SEF 2022. All the finalist students bring their posters, demos and prototypes to showcase their research outcomes. They all have demonstrated their efforts in working on their projects and presented high-quality research results. All great work completing challenging tasks!

The most impressive project is the "Intelligent Walker" in the Engineering area. The student (from Harmony School of Endeavor - Austin) has done really amazing work that involve both hardware (a real working prototype) and software (programming & wireless communication & App design on smart phones)! This project won the first place in the Senior-Engineering & Technology category.

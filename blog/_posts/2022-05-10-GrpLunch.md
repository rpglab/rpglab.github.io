Although the UH campus has fully opened since Fall 2021, most people in our group still work in a remote mode. It is time to get back to campus and mingle with each other in person rather than just 'meet' online. After the start of the Covid-19 in March 2020, we now decide to have the group (for those who live in the Houston area) to come back to the campus. Well, at least, come to the lab 2-3 days a week, among which a common day everyone comes is Tuesdays.

We started today with a group lunch at Eric's resturant in the UH Hilton hotel. This lunch is also a celebration lunch for <a class="off" href="/people/Ali-Siddique/">Ali Siddique</a> who defended his master's thesis on April 22, 2022 and graduated this May. <a class="off" href="/people/Ali-Siddique/">Ali Siddique</a> is the first (MS) student who graduated with a (MS) thesis in our group - the RPG Lab!

We also plan to have a group fun event (maybe one afternoon) this summer!

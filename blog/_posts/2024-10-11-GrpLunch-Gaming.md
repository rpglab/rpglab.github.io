On October 11, 2024, we had a group lunch at Mala Sichuan Bistro (Westheimer) to welcome our two new on-campus PhD students, <a class="off" href="/people/Fan-Jiang/">Fan Jiang</a> and <a class="off" href="/people/Linhan-Fang/">Linhan Fang</a>. This is the first time we had a group meal at an off-campus restaurant. After lunch, we went to the Gaming Room at Student Center South, our third time there.

* It was a great experience to serve as a judge and interact with talent middle/junior and high/senior school students at the 66th Science & Engineering Fair of Houston (SEFH) in February 2025. This is my second time at SEFH.

* Happy to meet another RPGLab member <a href="/people/Ann-Mary-Toms/" class="off">Ann Mary Toms</a> who is currently a PhD student. She was also there as a judge. 

* Also happy to meet multiple UH colleagues as judges and other judges there.

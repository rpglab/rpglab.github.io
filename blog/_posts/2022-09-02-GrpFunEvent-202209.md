This was our first Fun Event except for group lunch/dinners. We had a lot of fun at the on-campus UH Gaming Room at Student Center South.

We reserved 2 pooling tables for 4 hours from 5pm-9pm and 2 bowling lanes for 2 hours from 6pm-8pm. We prepared 4 large pizza, a large bag of different snacks, packs of 30 soft drink cans. My wife also helped prepare 10 gifting bags with various snacks including mooncakes; and three of them have something special as extra little bonuses. This is the first time we provide mooncakes after Covid-19 started. The last time we did it, it was three years ago in September 2019.

We really enjoyed it and look forward to having a second fun event!

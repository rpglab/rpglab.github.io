Although we have regular group innovation meetings and group research progress update meetings, some of the students had never met in person before! So, I decided to host a dinner party for the group on the weekend (11/20/2021) right before Thanksgiving. After working remotely for so long (1.5+ years) and after so many online meetings, finally we had this chance to meet each other and chat in person! Almost everyone made it to the dinner. Thank you for coming to the party!

We had great dinner and played Texas hold'em Poker afterwards. It was a enjoyable night!

I would also like to thank my wife here for preparing all the food! We had the roasted turkey, kabob, lamb, beef, pork, wings, pizza, and soup; of course, we also prepared snacks, desserts, fruits, soft drinks, wine and beer.

Group photos were taken in both the second floor patio and inside the house; they are attached below. I should have taken some photos for the dinner part and the game part!
